# Crawlers That I've Created

Someone says it's painful to make web crawlers. I don't agree with that. Because many trivial and tedious problems about information process and collecting in people's life can be resolved by crawlers. Actually, the knowledge to programming crawlers helps me have a better life.

## Crawlers and Motivations

* `sspai` ([sspai.com](https://sspai.com), original name 少数派): One day I remembered that I had caught sight of a website in comment section that I urgently need at that time. But I can't locate that comment. What's worst, comments of this website are fetched by XHR so I can't Google it. I wrote a simple crawler with Python in 15 minutes. Finally I got what I want in 10 minutes.
